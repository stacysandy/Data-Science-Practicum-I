# Data-Science-Practicum-I
A repository for my Data Science Practicum I Project at Regis University.

# Project Title: Food is the Fuel to our Lives, but What Are We Really Consuming?

# Objective
The objective of this assignment is to conduct a data analysis on food data from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) website FoodData Central (https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/index.html). The data sets and database repository is collected annually and biennially. An available API key is provided by FoodData Central and will actually terminate in March 31, 2020. 

Other available websites that contain supplemental data for the USDA FoodData Central website also include the following websites Center for Disease Control - National Center for Health Statistics: National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/default.aspx) And the USDA Agricultural Research Service (U.S. Department of Agriculture) - Food Surveys Research Group : Beltsville, MD (https://www.ars.usda.gov/northeast-area/beltsville-md-bhnrc/beltsville-human-nutrition-research-center/food-surveys-research-group/docs/whats-in-the-foods-you-eat-emsearch-toolem/). These supplemental websites may be used as a reference for further supporting material on my journey in looking at food consumption in the United States and the nutritional information of food.

# Research Questions
The research question at hand is that we need food to live and food is what makes our lives either better or worst. So, are we making the best food choices? What does nutritional value in food really mean? Are we eating nutritious food or are we eating what is easy, fast, and cheap? Do we really select the healthiest food? Or is our food selection based on other nutritional values or for other reasons? These high level research questions may expand upon themselves as the exploratory data analysis (EDA) can lead to other areas of interest or the unknown world of what is contained in the data.

# Data
The following data sets are available in csv format and can be downloaded at the following link https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/download-datasets.html. In summary, the available files include Foundation Foods, Branded Foods, SR Legacy, Supporting data for Downloads, and Full Download of All Data Types. These files are the most recent data up to December 2019. A full description of these data sets are defined in the USDA FoodData Central website under "Notes on Downloads".

# Available Documentations
FoodData Central Documentation for the data sets can be found at the following link https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/data-documentation.html.
FoodData Central API provides REST access to FoodData Central (FDC) and an API guide can be found at the following link: https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/api-guide.html
